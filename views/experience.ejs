      <h2>ChatGPT Efficiency Website (Current Project)</h2>
      <p>
        As a group, we are building a full web application to evaluate ChatGPT across
        different domains such as History, Social Science, and Computer Security.

        One member focuses on front-end structure and design (HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript
        and the dynamic assistant), one member builds the server and API integration
        using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and WebSockets, and one member is responsible for
        data processing, visualization, and result analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working together on this project gives us experience in coordinating roles, using Git/GitHub
        for collaboration, and connecting front-end pages with real back-end logic.

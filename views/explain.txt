Front-end skeleton is ready. Here are the hooks you can code against:

1.GET /api/add

Called from the Project page “Test /api/add” section.

Request format: /api/add?a=<number>&b=<number>

Expected response JSON:
{ "result": <number> }


2.GET /api/results

Called when the user clicks “Load Results” in the Results section.

Expected response JSON (example shape):
[
  { "domain": "History", "accuracy": 0.82, "avgTime": 1.3 },
  { "domain": "Social Science", "accuracy": 0.76, "avgTime": 1.6 },
  { "domain": "Computer Security", "accuracy": 0.70, "avgTime": 1.9 }
]


This will be passed into window.drawCharts(data) by the front-end.

3. WebSocket

The frontend connects to: ws://localhost:3000

When the user clicks “Start Evaluation”, the frontend sends:
{ "type": "start-eval" }


Any messages you broadcast from the server will be appended to the #wsMessages div as plain text, so you can send progress updates like:

"Starting evaluation for History..."

"Finished Social Science, accuracy: 0.78"

4. Charts

The canvases are already in the DOM:

#accuracyChart

#timeChart

You can write a charts.js file that defines:
window.drawCharts = function(data) { ... }


and use Chart.js to render the charts based on /api/results.

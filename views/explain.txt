Front-end skeleton is ready. Here are the hooks you can code against:

1.GET /api/add

Called from the Project page “Test /api/add” section.

Request format: /api/add?a=<number>&b=<number>

Expected response JSON:
{ "result": <number> }


2.GET /api/results

Called when the user clicks “Load Results” in the Results section.

Expected response JSON (example shape):
[
  { "domain": "History", "accuracy": 0.82, "avgTime": 1.3 },
  { "domain": "Social Science", "accuracy": 0.76, "avgTime": 1.6 },
  { "domain": "Computer Security", "accuracy": 0.70, "avgTime": 1.9 }
]


This will be passed into window.drawCharts(data) by the front-end.

3. WebSocket

The frontend connects to: ws://localhost:3000

When the user clicks “Start Evaluation”, the frontend sends:
{ "type": "start-eval" }


Any messages you broadcast from the server will be appended to the #wsMessages div as plain text, so you can send progress updates like:

"Starting evaluation for History..."

"Finished Social Science, accuracy: 0.78"

4. Charts

The canvases are already in the DOM:

#accuracyChart

#timeChart

You can write a charts.js file that defines:
window.drawCharts = function(data) { ... }


and use Chart.js to render the charts based on /api/results.




！！！
I removed node_modules from GitHub because it should not be tracked.
It is auto-generated and makes the repo unnecessarily large.
Just use npm install to recreate it.


When you write code, please let me know if you find any framework that needs to be supplemented. I will modify it.

    <h1>ChatGPT Efficiency Evaluation</h1>
    <p>This website is part of a course project that combines web design
          with an empirical evaluation of ChatGPT’s efficiency. The goal is to
          build an interactive site that presents how well ChatGPT performs
          across different domains and how its responses can be stored,
          analyzed, and visualized.</p>

        <!-- Research Approach -->
          <article class="evaluation-card">
        <h3>Research Approach</h3>
        <p> Our project follows an end-to-end web-based evaluation workflow.
            The front-end website is responsible for collecting user inputs,
            organizing the different question sets, and presenting the results
            in a clear and consistent layout. This includes the overall page
            structure, navigation, and the visual placeholders for charts.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the server side, Node.js and Express handle HTTP requests and
          connect to MongoDB for storing prompts, ChatGPT responses, and
          evaluation metrics. The website communicates with the ChatGPT API
          to generate answers, and WebSockets are used to support real-time
          updates during the evaluation process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the visualization and analysis layer uses the stored data
          to build charts that compare accuracy and response time across
          multiple domains under the same experimental settings.
        </p>
          </article>
      
          <!--Dataset Overview-->
          <article class="evaluation-card">
        <h3>Dataset overview</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset is organized into three main domains: History, Social
          Science, and Computer Security. Each domain contains a set of
          well-defined questions that are designed to test ChatGPT on
          factual knowledge, understanding of concepts, and problem-solving
          ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front-end structure helps group these questions by domain so
          that they can be selected and submitted in a controlled way.
          The server member prepares the scripts and API endpoints that
          send these questions to ChatGPT and store the responses in
          MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visualization and analysis member later works with this
          stored dataset to calculate accuracy scores, measure response
          times, and prepare the input needed for plotting charts.
        </p>
          </article>
      
          <!--Results Section-->
          <article class="evaluation-card">
        <h3>Results Section</h3>
        <p>
          The results section of the website is designed to present the
          outcome of the evaluation in a clear and interactive way.
          The front-end member creates the layout and chart placeholders
          so that the visualizations fit smoothly into the overall design
          of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the processed data from MongoDB, the visualization and
          analysis member builds charts that compare accuracy and response
          time across domains, and highlights patterns such as which
          domain is easier or more challenging for ChatGPT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, the three roles connect the full pipeline: from
          question design and data collection, to backend processing, and
          finally to visual presentation on the website for users to
          explore.
